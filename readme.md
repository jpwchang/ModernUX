ModernUX is a sleek and modern window decoration theme for the Kwin window
manager, designed to go well with flat themes such as
[Hex Lite](http://kde-look.org/content/show.php/Hex+Lite?content=164224).
It was created using
[Aeri](http://kde-look.org/content/show.php/Aeri+?content=162303) as a basis.

This project includes only a window decoration theme, and does not come with an
icon theme or an interface theme. I recommend Hex Lite (see above) as an
interface theme, and [numix](https://numixproject.org/) as an icon theme.

For a similar (though not identical) window decoration theme for Compiz/Emerald,
see my other theme [EmeraldEdge](https://github.com/jpwchang/EmeraldEdge/)
